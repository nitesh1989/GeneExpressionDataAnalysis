	Abstract = {We introduce and evaluate data analysis methods to interpret simultaneous measurement of multiple genomic features made on the same biological samples. Our tools use gene sets to provide an interpretable common scale for diverse genomic information. We show we can detect genetic effects, although they may act through different mechanisms in different samples, and show we can discover and validate important disease-related gene sets that would not be discovered by analyzing each data type individually.},

	Abstract = {A grand challenge in the post-genomic era is a complete computer representation
	of the cell and the organism, which will enable computational prediction
	of higher-level complexity of cellular processes and organism behavior
	from genomic information. Toward this end we have been developing
	a knowledge-based approach for network prediction, which is to predict,
	given a complete set of genes in the genome, the protein interaction
	networks that are responsible for various cellular processes. KEGG
	at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the reference knowledge base
	that integrates current knowledge on molecular interaction networks
	such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database), information about
	genes and proteins generated by genome projects (GENES/SSDB/KO databases)
	and information about biochemical compounds and reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION
	databases). These three types of database actually represent three
	graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and
	the chemical universe. New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge,
	both computationally and manually, about ortholog clusters in the
	KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to collect and analyze carbohydrate
	structures in the GLYCAN database.},

@article{Mootha2003a,
	Abstract = {DNA microarrays can be used to identify gene expression changes characteristic
	of human disease. This is challenging, however, when relevant differences
	are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical
	strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest
	but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally
	related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved
	in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased
	in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites
	of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1alpha and
	correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate
	this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism
	and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis
	of genomic profiling experiments.},

@article{Smyth2005,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate
	or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression
	are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual
	practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each
	probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the
	loss of valuable information about genewise variability. RESULTS:
	A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array
	replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength
	of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate
	linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common
	value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves
	the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and
	thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially
	expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes
	methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The
	method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving
	calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in
	RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows
	that the common correlation method results in substantially better
	discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which
	are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may
	be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances
	when the sample size is small. AVAILABILITY: The methodology is implemented
	in the limma software package for R, available from the CRAN repository

@article{Subramanian2005,
	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool
	in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information
	remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical
	method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting
	gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on
	gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological
	function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how
	GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including
	leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds
	little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival
	in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.
	The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package,
	together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene
	sets.},
