Basic R for Gene Expression Data Analysis
========================================================

Goal: To introduce a few useful commands and tools in R.
--------------------------------------------------------

**We recommend you use RStudio for this class, on all operating systems. You can use the following link** [http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/) **or good old fashioned google.**

If you want to extract the R code only from a markdown file, use the following command in the library **knitr** called *purl*.

```{r,echo =TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::purl("01_raw2dge.Rmd")
```

Useful resources for the class
-------------------------------

1. The affy vignette is a very good source, and is highly recommended. You can get this by installing and then just running **vignette("affy")** .
2. The very comprehensive tutorial section by UC-Riverside [http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/) .
