How to navigate the Markdown folder
========================================================

It is important to understand how to navigate through the markdown folder, as we used **knitr** to make the markdown files for the class.

Rstudio and Markdown
---------------------

1. Open the **.Rmd** files in RStudio and you have the option to **Knit HTML**. This will produce HTML documents of the code.

2. To extract the R code from the **.Rmd** files, you can use the command 

```{r,echo =TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::purl("filename.Rmd")
```

### The _.md_ files are used as teaching material to present the code and the analysis which was run on my computer. It is just a way to show the results without having to run them again.
