This is going to be a hands on training workshop, and we expect the students to follow along as we go through the code.
If anyone is stuck at any point or is unable to run some part of the code, we encourage you to ask us. This is important
to move forward in the workshop.


Instructions:
-------------

1. Please go to the link [https://github.com/nitesh1989/GeneExpressionDataAnalysis.git](https://github.com/nitesh1989/GeneExpressionDataAnalysis.git).

2. On the left bottom of your page, you have the link to **Download ZIP** . This will let you download the entire repository.

3. Unzip the file after downloading it. 

4. In each of the files, prior to running the R Code, you have to change the working directory. This is crucial.
